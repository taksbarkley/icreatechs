Comparative Report: Windows 11 vs. Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Introduction
Operating systems (OS) are the foundation of computer operations, taking care of hardware and software resources. This comparative report contrasts Windows 11, a proprietary OS created by Microsoft, with Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, a free, open-source Linux distribution supported by Canonical Ltd. The comparison will be based on usability, software compatibility, performance, and appropriate use cases.

1. Usability

Windows 11

Strengths: Easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI); smooth integration with Microsoft offerings; highly recognized by the general public.

Weaknesses: More resource-intensive; less adjustable in system setup.

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS:

Strengths: Adjustable desktop environments (e.g., GNOME); robust support base from the Linux community; perfect for users who are used to command-line interfaces.

Weaknesses: More difficult learning curve for beginners; could lack native support for certain proprietary software.

2. Software Compatibility
